### Possible Approaches to encrypting values in repository layer or service layers

#### 1. Encrypting the values in the repository layer

- Each repository will be responsible for encrypting the values before saving them to the database and decrypting them before returning them to the service layer.

```csharp
public class UserRepository : IUserRepository
{
	private readonly IEncryptionService _encryptionService;

	public UserRepository(IEncryptionService encryptionService)
	{
		_encryptionService = encryptionService;
	}

	public async Task<User> GetUserByIdAsync(int id)
	{
		var user = await _dbContext.Users.FindAsync(id);
		user.Email = _encryptionService.Decrypt(user.Email);
		return user;
	}

	public async Task AddUserAsync(User user)
	{
		user.Email = _encryptionService.Encrypt(user.Email);
		_dbContext.Users.Add(user);
		await _dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();
	}
}
```

This approach will work, but it has some drawbacks:

- It requires the developer to remember to encrypt and decrypt the values in the repository layer.


#### 2. Encrypting the values in the service layer

- The service layer will be responsible for encrypting the values before passing them to the repository layer and decrypting them before returning them to the client.
- This approach is better than the previous one because it centralizes the encryption and decryption logic in the service layer.
- It also makes it easier to test the encryption and decryption logic.

```csharp

public class UserService : IUserService
{
	private readonly IUserRepository _userRepository;
	private readonly IEncryptionService _encryptionService;

	public UserService(IUserRepository userRepository, IEncryptionService encryptionService)
	{
		_userRepository = userRepository;
		_encryptionService = encryptionService;
	}

	public async Task<User> GetUserByIdAsync(int id)
	{
		var user = await _userRepository.GetUserByIdAsync(id);
		user.Email = _encryptionService.Decrypt(user.Email);
		return user;
	}

	public async Task AddUserAsync(User user)
	{
		user.Email = _encryptionService.Encrypt(user.Email);
		await _userRepository.AddUserAsync(user);
	}
}
```

This approach is better than the previous one, but it still has some drawbacks:

- It requires the developer to remember to encrypt and decrypt the values in the service layer.

#### 3. Using a custom attribute to encrypt the values, and using source generators to generate the encryption methods.

- This approach is the one of the best ones because it automates the encryption and decryption process.
- It uses a custom attribute to mark the properties that need to be encrypted.
- It uses source generators to generate the encryption and decryption methods for the marked properties.
- This approach is the most efficient and the most secure one.
- It also makes it easier to test the encryption and decryption logic.
- It also makes it easier to maintain the encryption and decryption logic.

This approach will work, but it has some drawbacks:

- It requires the developer to remember to call the source generated methods.
- It requires the development of a source generator.

#### 4 . Using a custom attribute to encrypt the values, and using a middleware to encrypt and decrypt the values.

- This approach also the one of the best one because it automates the encryption and decryption process.
- It uses a custom attribute to mark the properties that need to be encrypted.
- It uses a middleware to encrypt and decrypt the values before passing them to the repository layer and before returning them to the client.
- It is the cleanest solution.

This approach will work, but it has some drawbacks:

- It requires .netCore 8.0 or higher, as it uses interceptors in the service registration.
- It requires the use of attributes and development of a interceptor for the methods either in the repositories or servicse.


```csharp
class Startup {
	public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
		services.AddEncryptionService();
		services.AddUserRepository();
		services.AddUserService();

		//this will intercept all services registrations that have the attribute [InterceptAndEncrypt]
		//this will work for all classes either in the repositories or services
		services.InterceptAndEncryptServiceValues();
	}
}
```
